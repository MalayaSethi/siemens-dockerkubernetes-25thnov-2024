anonymous volume
---------------------------------
no name
-v /<container-dir-path>
this volume is persisted even when the docker container is stopped and even removed
for every container, running the same image, new anonymous volume will be assigned (until and unless you want to share the anonymous volume of some other container)

Note: 
If the docker container is run using "--rm" flag the anonymous volume(s) will be removed, when the container is stopped and subsequently removed.

But if the volume(s) is/are being shared by multiple container, then the first container, for which this volume was created, will NOT be removed when the first container is stopped (it started with --rm flag, which should have removed the volume when this container is stopped, and subsequently removed).

But if the all the containers which are sharing this volume, started with --rm flag, when the last of them is stopped and subsequently removed, the volumes  will finally be removed.

But if the any of the container which is sharing this volume, started not with --rm flag, when all of them are stopped and subsequently removed, the volumes  will still be there???

named volume:
------------------------------
you can create a named volume manually:
>docker volume create feedback-volume

you can assign this volume to one or many containers

you will provide a name for the volume
-v <volume-name>:/<container-dir-path>
this volume is persisted even when the docker container is stopped and even removed. --rm flag will NOT have any impact on it.

when the container is removed, and then again created, if you use the same named volume from previous cycle, it will be attached with the existing named volume.


sharing volumes:
---------------------
>docker run -d --rm -p 3001:3001 --name feedback-container-2 --env-file .env --volumes-from feedback-container-1 feedback-app:v1
